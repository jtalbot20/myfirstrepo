   <!--I have used a separate css file for all my projects so far so maybe it's different
   and I just don't remember but why do you have all those different p, p1, p2, and p3 styles?
   You use most of them in your paragraph below but you have them all formatted the same anyway.
   I think it would be easier and work the same to just use one <p></p> for the whole paragraph
   below and just have this one style for all paragraphs:
   p{
      color:black;
      font-style: italic;
    }

    I didn't want to actually make those changes as I would need to remove a lot of your style <section>
      to make it work.
    </section>

  <style>

 h1{
    color: black;
    text-align: center;
    font-style: italic;
    font-size: 40px
  }

 p{
    color:black;
    font-style: italic;
  }

 p1{
      color:black;
      font-style: italic;
    }

 p2{
     color:black;
      font-style: italic;
    }

 p3{
     color:black;
      font-style: italic;
    }

<!--  Cute baby, btw.  Your first picture is sized to be bigger than the other two and
the way it shows on the page made me think the vertical list was something I could click on.
You might want to make all the images the same size or put a frame around that first one or something.
I made the following changes if you want to activate and use any of them.  I added a little padding
to your header so it wasn't right at the top of the page.  I also made all the pictures the
same size and centered them.  I would do add a border and separate them too but since you're not
using a css file and it won't let me comment out stuff in your style section, I'm going to leave that out.
<h1 style=padding-top:20px;> Portfolio </h1>

 <p1> A couple of the photos above are screen shots that I have created.
      The frist picture is something I created in HTML code. The second and
      third picture are things i solved in javascript.</p1>
 <p2> So there are a couple things that i have done at work with C++</p2>
 <p3> I got to create a GUI interface for automatically picking differnt models
      in a program called Pro Engineer. With in Pro Engineer there is program
      called Smart Assembly. That is where you place the C++ code so that thead
      GUI interface can pop. </p3>
